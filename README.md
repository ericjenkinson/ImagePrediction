#  Image Prediction

---

A simple app that demonstrates using CoreML and the MobileNetV2 image classification model. The predict method in ContentView preps the image and call MobileNetV2.prediction.

The MobileNetV2 model is not included in this repo. You can download the model at [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/). Once downloaded drop the MobileNetV2.mlmodel file into the project.
